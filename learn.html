					<h1><a id="plastic">Plastic is everywhere!</a></h1>
					<p><img src="images/8billion.jpg" alt="8 billion people can help">For the last half-century, plastic has become an integral part of our daily life. From furniture to grocery bags, from
					vehicle parts to toys, plastic is an unavoidable element of our lives in a variety of forms. However, from being
					regarded as a very vital presence in the contemporary world, plastic has now come to be looked upon as a material of
					immense potential destruction and harm.</p>
					
					<p>As is commonly known, plastic isn’t biodegradable, which accentuates the threat of lingering waste plastic for years and
					for generations to come. According to estimates, people around the world throw away almost four million tons of trash
					every day, of which 12.8% is plastic, polluting land, air and water. While plastic thrown into landfills contaminates
					the soil and groundwater with harmful chemicals and microorganisms, the effects of marine pollution caused by plastic
					are immeasurable.</p>

					<p>Just like on land, even in the oceanic areas, the effects of plastic on marine life has started to be felt. The studies
					reveal that around 12.7 million tonnes of plastic waste are washed into the ocean every year. The United Nations
					Environment Programme estimates there could be as many as 51 trillion microplastic particles in the oceans already.</p>
			
					<p>The amount of garbage in the seas also pollutes the oceanic waters, just like the plastic harm the marine life in
					several ways. Dispensation of hazardous materials, including toxic substance such as Bisphenol A, which has been found
					commonly in many plastic commodities, pollutes the water badly. Since Bisphenol A doesn’t get diluted in water, it
					results in grave environmental problems. Similarly, the debris uses oxygen as it degrades, resulting in the low level of
					oxygen in the waters. As oxygen levels go down, it badly affects the survival of marine animals including whales,
					dolphins and penguins.</p>
					
					<p>The ruination of the ocean doesn’t also only include the high seas. It also includes the shores and the beaches which
					are infested with plastic. The plastic waste can either float for miles on the water or they could be submerged on the
					sea-bed or commonly be found on the sea-shore. Such congested areas become easy threats to birds and other land animals
					that get caught up in the choke-hold of plastic. Irrespective of the location, the eco-system gets impaired hugely
					because of such marine debris.</p>
					
					<p>Ocean garbage in the form of plastic also leads to invasion of non-indigenous species and organisms in naturally
					occurring marine colonies, thus posing a threat to the functioning of ecosystems. The billions of micro-plastic
					particles floating in the ocean are all potential carriers of non-indigenous invasive species.
