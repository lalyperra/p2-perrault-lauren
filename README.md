issues: I got the hamburger menu to work and then when I was trying to fix the size of the menu to keep the submenu attached...I lost it and couldn't figure out what I did. :(  Ran out of time to fix this one. 
Brydon tested my API for me and she had it working but when I tried it, it didn't work.  I'm hoping it's a firewall issue on my side and that it works for you.
